## Overview

`extmod` is a CLI, runtime wrapper and API that allows Node applications to dynamically load remote ESM modules at runtime. To put it simply, `extmod`
enables **http(s)-based import statements** within Node applications.

`extmod` leverages already existing Node machinery, namely [ESM module loaders](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#customization-hooks) and [module permissions](https://nodejs.org/api/permissions.html#module-based-permissions), to give both stability and security to the modules
you are loading into your application.

`extmod` also updates your modules in real-time, driven by etags or max-age Cache-Control headers, to enable the freshest code to be used, all out of the box.

Use `extmod` to:

- Pull remote configuration files, ala feature flagging.
- Leverage shared, common code in your organization.
- Automatically bundle and serve frontend components in SSR/RSC applications, ala Federated Modules.

## Getting Started

> Node 18.x or greater is required

### Installation

<Group>
  <GroupItem label="yarn">
    ```sh 
    yarn add extmod 
    ```
  </GroupItem>
  <GroupItem label="npm">
    ```sh 
    npm i extmod 
    ```
  </GroupItem>
  <GroupItem label="pnpm">
    ```sh 
    pnpm add extmod
    ```
  </GroupItem>
</Group>

### Initialization

The next step is to generate a `.extmod.json` configuration file.

<Group>
  <GroupItem label="npm">
    ```sh
    npx extmod init
    ```
  </GroupItem>
  <GroupItem label="pnpm">
    ```sh 
    pnpm exec extmod init
    ```
  </GroupItem>
</Group>

### Allow Remotes

By default, remote modules are not enabled. You need to opt-in URLs that you have deemed safe to run within your application.

To allow a remote URL to be loaded, you can use the `config add-remote` command.

<Group>
  <GroupItem label="npm">
    ```sh 
    npx extmod config add-remote https://my.module.com/
    ```
  </GroupItem>
  <GroupItem label="pnpm">
    ```sh
    pnpm exec extmod config add-remote https://my.module.com/
    ```
  </GroupItem>
</Group>

### Import Remotes

You can now import your remote module in your application as you would any other ESM module.

<Group>
  <GroupItem label="typescript">
    ```ts 
    import utilities from "https://my.module.com/utilities.mjs";

    console.log(utilities.magicNumber) // 42!
    ```

  </GroupItem>
  <GroupItem label="javascript">
    ```js 
    import utilities from "https://my.module.com/utilities.mjs";

    console.log(utilities.magicNumber) // 42!
    ```

  </GroupItem>
</Group>

### Application Bootstrap

The final requirement is to leverage the `extmod run` command wrapper when you bootstrap your application.
`extmod` will pass through anything you add after "run" to Node, however it will inject runtime flags which enable
the `extmod` ESM loader as well as apply the module permissions policy you have defined.

<Group>
  <GroupItem label="node.js">
    ```sh 
      extmod run index.mjs
    ```
  </GroupItem>
  <GroupItem label="next.js">
    ```sh
      extmod run next dev 
    ```
  </GroupItem>
</Group>

## Mechanisms of Action

`extmod` goes through various stages depending on the modules being requested, their ESM cache status and the module contents.

### Resolving

When `extmod` finds an import starting with `/^https?/`, it will automatically make a HEAD request to that
module in order to determine whether:

1. It has seen this specific module before.
2. It has a changed `etag` value, indicating it has changed.
3. It has a `max-age` Cache-Control header.

Depending on the answers to the questions above, `extmod` will either load the existing module in the local ESM
cache or it will make a GET request for an updated verison of the module.

> If no etag or max-age Cache-Control header is found, once loaded, the remote module will be cached within the ESM cache
> indefinitely. There is currently no way to "bust" or remove a loaded ESM module from the ESM cache, so the cache will
> grow unbounded if not restricted.

By default, bare module imports (such as "react" or "lodash") are resolved **locally**. This aligns with how most bundlers work with "externals" defined.
You should treat bare module imports in your remote modules as being external, where `extmod` will look to the local project for that dependency. If you wish for your remote modules to leverage different versions other than what
is supplied locally, you should pre-bundle your module with the dependency.

#### Permissions

Pulling content from potentially untrusted sources has inherent security risks. `extmod` tries to allievate this concern by leveraging Node's
[module permission](https://nodejs.org/api/permissions.html#module-based-permissions) infrastructure, which validates only approved modules when they are loaded by the runtime, and rejects all others.

Remote modules are not enabled by default. You must use the `extmod` CLI's config actions to add allowable remote module URLs (or domains) that you trust
in order for them to be loaded into your applications.

See the [Configuration](#configuration) section on how to do this.

### Loading

After it has been determined a remote module should be loaded, a GET request against the module URL is made. Upon successful request,
the remote module is fed through the same import process

### Error Handling

The points of failure in the resolution and loading process should be well known in order to guard effectively in your applications. `extmod` tries to
make handling these points of failure easier by bubbling up the error into your application code as data, rather than as a bonefide error.

There are two primary classes errors: network errors (both in resolving and loading modules) and module errors (loading a CommonJS vs ESM module for instance).

Handling these errors involves using the `extmod` supplied error key and determining whether an error exists within your application code.

<Group>
  <GroupItem label="typescript">
    ```ts 
    // Import our remote component
    import * as utilities from "https://my.module.com/utilities.mjs";
    // Import extmod error keys
    import { EXTMOD_ERROR, EXTMOD_ERROR_CODE, EXTMOD_ERROR_REASON, Extmod } from "extmod";
    // Deconstruct out a possible error
    const { [EXTMOD_ERROR]: error, default } = utilities as Extmod<{ default: any }>;

    if (error) {
      const {
        [EXTMOD_ERROR_CODE]: code,
        [EXTMOD_ERROR_REASON]: reason,
      } = error;
      // handle code and reason
    } else {
      // use your default (if applicable) import
    }
    ```

  </GroupItem>
  <GroupItem label="javascript">
    ```js 
    // Import our remote component
    import * as utilities from "https://my.module.com/utilities.mjs";
    // Import extmod error keys
    import { EXTMOD_ERROR, EXTMOD_ERROR_CODE, EXTMOD_ERROR_REASON, Extmod } from "extmod";
    // Deconstruct out a possible error
    const { [EXTMOD_ERROR]: error, default } = utilities;

    if (error) {
      const {
        [EXTMOD_ERROR_CODE]: code,
        [EXTMOD_ERROR_REASON]: reason,
      } = error;
      // handle code and reason
    } else {
      // use your default (if applicable) import
    }
    ```

### Server Side Rendering

Since `extmod` is leveraging normal Node `import` machinery, all imported modules are assumed to be tailored for a server environment by default.
However, with the rise of Server Side Rendering frameworks, the lines have been blurred on what imported code is being ran on the server and ran
on the client (browser).

> Currently, only React 18+ is supported.

When `extmod` detects an import is to be used in a browser environment, it will automatically write it and any imported dependencies to disk, bundle
them (via esbuild) and make it available to the browser for rendering.

#### Import Signaling

There are two ways to trigger client bundling through `extmod`, import attributes or the `"use client"` directive in the remote module.

##### Import Attribute

A new feature of ECMAScript allows attributes to be attached to import statements in order to inform the ESM loader of particularities around _what_
is being imported. `extmod` leverages this with a new `client` attribute to singal the loader that the imported module should be treated as a client
module.

<Group>
  <GroupItem label="typescript">
    ```ts 
      import { MyModule } from "https://my.module.com/index.mjs" with { type: "client" };
    ```
  </GroupItem>
  <GroupItem label="javascript">
    ```js 
      import { MyModule } from "https://my.module.com/index.mjs" with { type: "client" };
    ```
  </GroupItem>
</Group>

##### "use client" Directive

React and frameworks have aligned on the `"use client"` Javascript directive to describe the server/client boundry in Server Side Rendering. `extmod` looks
for this directive in remotely loaded modules to enforce that boundry and create the client bundle dynamically.

> You do not add "use client" in your application code, rather you define it in your remote module and `extmod` will detect it automatically during runtime.

<Group>
  <GroupItem label="typescript">
    ```ts 
    "use client";

    // Browser-centric code
    ```
  </GroupItem>
  <GroupItem label="javascript">
    ```js 
    "use client";

    // Browser-centric code
    ```
  </GroupItem>
</Group>

#### Suspense + Bundling

In order for a seamless UX, `extmod` uses React's `Suspense` to pause component rendering while the bundling process occurs; the frontend should continue rendering unabated.
When you declare a client import, `extmod` immediately returns a default export containing a `Suspense`-based component that will resolve into a `<script>` tag
containing the location of your bundle on disk.

<Group>
  <GroupItem label="typescript">
    ```ts 
    import { FC } from "react";
    import Component from "https://my.module.com/index.mjs" with { type: "client" };

    export const MyRemoteComponent: FC = () => (
      // Initially Component resolves to a placeholder while the bundle is created.
      // After bundling is completed, a <script> tag is rendered here with a src
      // corresponding to the completed bundle location on the server.
      <Component />
    );
    ```
  </GroupItem>
  <GroupItem label="javascript">
    ```js 
    import Component from "https://my.module.com/index.mjs" with { type: "client" };

    export const MyRemoteComponent = () => (
      // Initially Component resolves to a placeholder while the bundle is created.
      // After bundling is completed, a <script> tag is rendered here with a src
      // corresponding to the completed bundle location on the server.
      <Component />
    );
    ```
  </GroupItem>
</Group>

#### Client-side Utility

An optional but encouraged step is to use the exported `ExtmodSuspense` component. After your client side component has successfully resolved to
a `<script>` and the bundle has been loaded into the browser, you need a way to ultimately render that component in-place, including adding an optional
fallback. 

`ExtmodSuspense` uses a `MutationObserver` to watch when a `<script>` tag is rendered within it and then replaces that `<script>` tag with the 
bundle code that was loaded into the browser - all completely automatically.

<Group>
  <GroupItem label="typescript">
    ```ts 
    import { FC } from "react";
    import { ExtmodSuspense } from "extmod/client";
    import Component from "https://my.module.com/index.mjs" with { type: "client" };

    export const MyRemoteComponent: FC = () => (
      // The wrapper waits until our <script> tag is rendered via Suspense.
      // It then replaces it with our bundled client component.
      <ExtmodSuspense 
        component={<Component />}
        fallback={<div>Loading...</div>} 
      />
    );
    ```
  </GroupItem>
  <GroupItem label="javascript">
    ```js 
    import { ExtmodSuspense } from "extmod/client";
    import Component from "https://my.module.com/index.mjs" with { type: "client" };

    export const MyRemoteComponent = () => (
      // The wrapper waits until our <script> tag is rendered via Suspense.
      // It then replaces it with our bundled client component.
      <ExtmodSuspense 
        component={<Component />}
        fallback={<div>Loading...</div>} 
      />
    );
    ```
  </GroupItem>
</Group>

## Configuration

`extmod` configuration lives in a `.extmod.json` file at the root of your project and drives key features. Because of the complexity of
managing module permissions, it is advised to use the `extmod` CLI unless you are versed in how Node module permissions are used. That being said,
`extmod` uses an opinionated configuration of the module permission spec speficially tailored for remote modules.

For further information on the mechanics about how Node module permissions work, consult the [Node documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/permissions.html#module-based-permissions).

> The `.extmod.json` configuraiton strictly validated before any CLI command is ran. To avoid errors, do not manually change the configuration file.
> Rather, use the CLI to perform operations against the configuraiton file.

```ts
{
  interface ExtmodConfiguration {
    // The current configuration verison
    version: string;
    // A mapping of aliases to remote module URLs
    aliases: Record<string, string>;
    // The nested Node module permissions configuration
    policy: {
      // Individual remote file permissions
      resources: {
        [url: string]: {
          dependencies: boolean;
          integrity?: string;
        };
      };
      // Remote, cascading path permissions
      // e.g. https://my.module/*, allowing any module under the my.module domain
      scopes: {
        [url: string]: {
          dependencies: boolean;
          integrity?: string;
        }
      };
    };
  }
}
```

## API

The externally facing API of `extmod` is quite simple and usually not needed.

### extmod

The exported `extmod()` function is available for situations where using the normal `import` Node semantics are not ideal. This is usually 
done in cases where the application is using a bundler that transforms `import` into `require` or statically evalutes `import` at build-time
and is not equipt to handle remote imports.

```ts
export type extmod = (
  url: string,
  type?: "json" | "client",
) => Promise<any>
```

Under the hood, `extmod()` simply wraps the normal `import` in an `eval` to "hide" until runtime, to which things perform as expected.
