## Overview

`extmod` is a CLI, runtime wrapper and API that allows Node applications to dynamically load remote ESM modules at runtime. To put it simply, `extmod`
enables **http(s)-based import statements** within Node applications.

`extmod` leverages already existing Node machinery, namely ESM module loaders and module permissions, to give both stability and security to the modules
you are loading into your application.

`extmod` also updates your modules in real-time, driven by etags or max-age Cache-Control headers, to enable the freshest code to be used, all out of the box.
